       "<span style=white-space:pre-wrap>'INTRODUCTION\\n1.1 The objective of the South African Telemedicine System as established by the\\n    National Department of Health is to deliver healthcare services at a distance to\\n    South African communities in under-served areas. The system has been established\\n    to alleviate the human resource crisis as experienced and is geared to improve the\\n    links and communication between developed healthcare facilities and the\\n    underdeveloped rural areas. Different categories of Health Care Practitioners will be\\n    involved.\\n1.2 The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) has a mandate to regulate\\n    healthcare provision by ensuring that services are provided by qualified and skilled\\n    healthcare practitioners. This regulatory mandate applies to healthcare practitioner\\n    in both state and privately-owned health care institutions. It is the mandate of the\\n    HPCSA to protect the “patient” against possible abuse by healthcare practitioner on\\n    one hand and to provide guidance for good practice to the professions.\\n1.3 All Telemedicine services should involve a healthcare provider where there is an\\n    actual face-to-face consultation and physical examination of the patient in a clinical\\n    setting. The consulting practitioner will communicate the information to the servicing\\n    practitioner, who will then provide the necessary assistance.\\nNote: These guidelines must be read as a whole and not piece-meal as the overall\\npurpose may be lost. The guidelines must further be read in conjunction with\\nother ethical booklets of the HPCSA which include but are not limited to:\\n        Booklet No 1: General ethical guidelines for healthcare professions\\n        Booklet No 9: Seeking patients’ informed consent\\n        Booklet No 10: Confidentiality\\n                                               5\\n\\n2. PURPOSE\\nThe purpose of these guidelines is twofold:\\n       (a) Firstly to provide an ethical framework that draws from the core values and\\n       standards in Booklet No 1 and pertinent laws.\\n       (b) Secondly, to provide guidelines to Healthcare Practitioners engaged in\\n       telemedicine practices within and outside the South Africa.\\n3. DEFINITION OF CONCEPTS\\nThese guidelines first provide definitions of telemedicine and other related terminology\\nas used in the guidelines.\\n3.1 Telemedicine\\nFor the purposes of these guidelines, “telemedicine” is defined as:\\n       The practice of medicine using electronic communications, information\\n       technology or other electronic means between a healthcare practitioner in one\\n       location and a healthcare practitioner in another location for the purpose of\\n       facilitating, improving and enhancing clinical, educational and scientific\\n       healthcare and research, particularly to the under serviced areas in the Republic\\n       of South Africa.\\nNote:\\n 1. Telemedicine involves secure videoconferencing or similar forms of technology\\n     which enable healthcare practitioners to replicate the interaction of traditional face-\\n     to-face consultations between healthcare practitioners and the patient.\\n                                              6\\n\\n  2. Telemedicine as defined refers to where information is exchanged electronically\\n     either on or off-line, formally, informally or as a need for a second opinion.\\n3.2 Health establishment\\n“Health establishment” means the whole or part of a public or private institution, facility,\\nbuilding or place, whether for profit or not, that is designed to provide inpatient or\\noutpatient treatment, and diagnostic or therapeutic interventions\\n3.3 Healthcare practitioner\\n“Healthcare practitioner” means a person providing health services, registered in terms\\nof the Health Professions Act No 56 of 1974, to include any other appropriate disciplines\\nas defined in the National Health Act No 61 of 2003.\\n3.4 The consulting healthcare practitioner\\nThe “consulting healthcare practitioner” refers to the practitioner who conducts a “face-\\nto-face” interview or examination with the patient or refers patient’s information to a\\nremote location for further advice or intervention.\\n3.5 The servicing healthcare practitioner\\nThe “servicing healthcare practitioner” refers to the practitioner who offers advice or\\nintervention or patient information from a remote location.\\n3.6 The requesting patient\\nThe “requesting patient” is the patient who requests to be treated by the servicing\\nhealthcare practitioner. This applies only where there is already an existing relationship\\nbetween the patient and the healthcare practitioner.\\n                                                7\\n\\n3.7 Other terms that relate to consultation\\nOther terms relate to consultation as used in telemedicine as described by the World\\nMedical Association:\\n3.7.1 Asynchronous: Refers to data transmission that involves a mechanism where the\\n       patient information from the consulting healthcare practitioner\\'s site is temporarily\\n       stored and then retransmitted to the servicing healthcare practitioner\\'s site or vice\\n       versa. A common asynchronous transmission includes the transmission of\\n       patient information via email.\\n3.7.2 Synchronous: Refers to the continuous, uninterrupted transmission of patient\\n       information from the consulting health care practitioner\\'s site to the consultant\\n       health care practitioner\\'s site, or vice versa. The flow of patient information does\\n       not include any storage or intended delay in the transmission of the patient data.\\n4. ETHICAL GUIDELINES\\nAlthough telemedicine has become an essential tool in alleviating human resource\\ncrises and supporting primary healthcare services, particularly those of vulnerable\\ncommunities in South Africa. It also raises important ethical and legal issues.\\n4.1 Competence, registration and authorisation\\n4.1.1 According to the Health Professions Act, No 56 of 1974, registration is a\\n       prerequisite for practising a profession in terms of which a professional board has\\n       been established, where such practice is for gain within South Africa, or for any\\n       other health profession the scope which has been defined by the Minister in\\n       terms of the Act, unless a practitioner is registered in terms of the Act in respect\\n       of such profession.\\n4.1.2 Only practitioners who have been deemed competent and are registered in their\\n       respective professions are authorised to participate in telemedicine practice in\\n                                               8\\n\\n      South Africa either as consulting healthcare practitioners or servicing healthcare\\n      practitioners.\\n4.1.3 In the case of telemedicine across country borders, practitioners serving South\\n      African patients should be registered with the regulating bodies in their original\\n      states as well as with the HPCSA.\\n4.1.4 Consulting healthcare practitioners are responsible for ensuring that the servicing\\n      healthcare practitioner is competent according to South African healthcare\\n      standards.\\n4.1.5 Consulting healthcare practitioners and servicing healthcare practitioners are\\n      held to the same standards of medical practice as healthcare practitioners who\\n      conduct face-to-face consultations.\\n4.2   Healthcare practitioner-patient relationship\\n4.2.1 The relationship between the patient and the healthcare practitioner is\\n      established when the practitioner agrees to treat the patient and the patient\\n      agrees to be treated.\\n4.2.2 In telemedicine the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at\\n      the time telemedicine technologies are used.\\n4.2.3 The relationship between the patient and the healthcare practitioner must be\\n      based on mutual trust and respect, and this applies to both servicing and\\n      consulting practitioners.\\n4.2.4 Core ethical values as outlined in the HPCSA guidelines for Healthcare\\n      practitioners are also applicable in telemedicine practice and the fact that a\\n      patient’s information can be moved using electronic means does not alter the\\n      ethical duties of health care practitioner.\\n                                              9\\n\\n4.2.5 The professional discretion of healthcare practitioners engaging in telemedicine\\n        regarding the diagnosis, scope of care or treatment should not be limited or\\n        influenced by non-clinical considerations of telemedicine technologies.\\n4.3 Assumption of primary responsibility\\n4.3.1 The World Medical Association (WMA) makes a distinction between telemedicine\\n        consulting and the servicing practitioners regarding where the primary\\n        responsibility lies.\\n4.3.2 According to the WMA:\\n    (a) The consulting practitioner remains responsible for the treatment, decisions and\\n        other recommendations given to the patient, as well as for keeping detailed\\n        records of the patient’s condition and information transmitted and received from\\n        the servicing practitioner.\\n    (b) The servicing practitioner must keep detailed records of the advice he or she\\n        delivers as well as the information he or she receives and on which the advice is\\n        based.\\n    (c) The servicing practitioner must further ensure that the advice or treatment\\n        suggestions given were understood by the consulting practitioner or the patient.\\n4.4     Evaluation and treatment of patient\\n4.4.1 A documented medical evaluation must be done and the relevant clinical history\\n        necessary to diagnose underlying conditions as well as any contra-indications\\n        regarding the recommended treatment must be obtained before providing\\n        treatment, including issuing prescriptions, electronically or otherwise.\\n                                              10\\n\\n4.4.2 Treatment, including issuing a prescription based solely on an online\\n        questionnaire does not constitute an acceptable standard of care.\\n4.4.3 When prescribing care using telemedicine consulting practitioners should ensure\\n        that informed consent is taken in accordance with the standards practice used in\\n        face-to-face issuing of prescriptions.\\n4.5     Professional duties\\n4.5.1 Healthcare practitioners engaging in telemedicine must observe the professional\\n        duties imposed in the HPCSA’s General Ethical Guidelines for Good Practice.\\n4.5.2 Duties to patients include, but are not limited to, always acting in the best interest\\n        or well-being of the patient, respecting patients’ privacy and dignity, giving\\n        patients the information they need about their conditions, and maintaining\\n        confidentiality at all times as required by the National Health Act No 61 of 2003\\n        and the SA National Patients’ Rights Charter.\\n4.5.3 Healthcare practitioners should not give medical advice or provide treatment\\n        using telemedicine without obtaining proper informed consent from the patient for\\n        both the treatment to be given and the use of telemedicine technology.\\n4.5.4 The consulting and servicing healthcare practitioners they should verify:\\n    (a) The location of the consulting or servicing healthcare practitioner;\\n    (b) The identity and qualifications of the consulting or servicing healthcare\\n        practitioner; and\\n    (c) The identity of the patient.\\n                                               11\\n\\n4.6 Duty to inform and informed consent\\n4.6.1 This section must be read in conjunction with HPCSA guidelines regarding\\n      informed consent in Booklet 9 and the provisions of the National Health Act.\\n4.6.2 Informed consent for the use of telemedicine technologies must be obtained in\\n      writing.\\n4.6.3 Informed consent documentation for telemedicine practice should include the\\n      following:\\n      (a) The identities of the patient and the servicing healthcare practitioner.\\n      (b) The servicing healthcare practitioner’s practice number.\\n      (c) The types of transmissions consented to using telemedicine technologies\\n          (e.g. prescriptions, refills, appointment scheduling, patient education etc.).\\n      (d) Agreement by the patient that the servicing practitioner will decide whether or\\n          not the condition being diagnosed or treated is appropriate for a telemedicine\\n          consultation.\\n      (e) Details of the security measures taken with the use of telemedicine\\n          technologies, such as encrypting data, password protected screen savers and\\n          data files, or the use of other reliable authentication techniques.\\n      (f) Any material risks to confidentiality arising from the use of telemedicine\\n          technologies that may influence the patient’s decision to consent.\\n      (g) The patient’s express consent to the transmission of the patient’s personal\\n          medical information to a consulting healthcare practitioner or other\\n          appropriate third parties.\\n4.6.3 When telemedicine is used the patient should be informed regarding who will\\naccess their information, the purpose of the telemedicine service, the cost of the service\\nand what the implications of the use of such information will be.\\n                                              12\\n\\n4.6.4 It is the duty and responsibility of the consulting practitioner to obtain informed\\nconsent for telemedicine purposes.\\n4.6.5 The documentation regarding informed consent for telemedicine practice should\\n       include the following:\\n   (a) The patient’s name and address and the location or site of consultation;\\n   (b) The consulting practitioner’s name, practice address and number, and location;\\n   (c) The servicing practitioner’s or practitioner’s names, practice addresses and\\n       numbers, and location;\\n   (d) A brief explanation of telemedicine;\\n   (e) The types of transmissions consented to using telemedicine technologies (e.g.\\n       prescriptions, refills, appointment scheduling, patient education etc.).\\n   (f) Details of the security measures taken with the use of telemedicine technologies,\\n       such as encrypting data, password protected screen savers and data files, or the\\n       use of other reliable authentication techniques.\\n   (g) Any material risks to confidentiality arising from the use of telemedicine\\n       technologies that may influence the patient’s decision to consent.\\n   (h) The expected risks, possible benefits of and alternatives to telemedicine;\\n   (i) Agreement by the patient that the servicing practitioner will decide whether or not\\n       the condition being diagnosed or treated is appropriate for a telemedicine\\n       consultation.\\n   (j) The patient’s agreement, after a full explanation was given, including the\\n       patient’s express consent to the transmission of the patient’s personal medical\\n       information to a consulting healthcare practitioner or other appropriate third\\n       parties.\\n   (k) The signature of patient, the patient’s parent, the patient’s guardian or the\\n       patient’s caregiver - the relationship to the patient should be specified;\\n   (l) The signature of the witness.\\n                                              13\\n\\n4.6.6 A copy of the consent form should be kept with patient’s records and a duplicate\\n       given to the patient.\\n4.6.7 In the case of videoconference consultations, the patient must be aware of the\\n       presence of other people on the other side, and that the patient’s identity may be\\n       revealed to such people, and must consent to this.\\n4.7 Patient confidentiality\\n4.7.1 The patient must at all times be assured that their confidentiality is protected.\\n4.7.2 Patient confidentiality should be ensured at both the consulting and servicing\\n       practitioners’\\n       sites and should follow the provisions of the Constitution, the National Health Act\\n       No 61 of 2003, the Promotion of Access to Information Act No 2 of 2000, the\\n       Protection of Personal Information Act No 4 of 2013, the Common law and the\\n       HPCSA’s ethical guidelines on patient confidentiality in Booklet 10 which\\n       generally state that it is every practitioner’s duty to make sure that information is\\n       effectively protected against improper disclosure at all times.\\n4.7.3 HPCSA’s booklet on Confidentiality further provides guidelines on how patient\\n       information may be disclosed for example, in the case of research, education,\\n       clinical audit, financial audit or even for the publication of case histories and\\n       photographs].\\n4.7.4 Policies and procedures for documentation, maintenance and transmission of\\n       records regarding telemedicine consultations should be maintained at the same\\n       standard of care as face-to-face consultations.\\n4.7.5 Policies and procedures for telemedicine should deal with: (a) Confidentiality; (b)\\n       Healthcare personnel apart from the healthcare practitioners who will process the\\n       electronic information; (c) Hours of operation; (d) Types of transactions that are\\n       permitted electronically; (e) Required patient information to be included in\\n       electronic communications (e.g. name, identification number and type of\\n       transaction); (f) Archival and retrieval oversight mechanisms; and (g) Quality\\n       oversight mechanisms.\\n                                               14\\n\\n4.7.6 Electronic transmissions, (e.g. email, prescriptions and laboratory results) must\\n       be secure within existing technology (e.g. password protected, encrypted\\n       electronic prescriptions or other reliable authentication techniques). It is the\\n       responsibility of the healthcare practitioners to ensure that these non-healthcare\\n       personnel do not violate patient confidentiality.\\n4.7.7 All patient-practitioner electronic communications must be stored and filed in the\\n       patient’s medical record file in line with traditional record-keeping policies and\\n       procedures.\\n4.8 Routine, specialists and emergency consultations\\nThere is a need to provide guidelines on routine, emergency or specialist consultations\\nusing telemedicine technologies.\\n4.8.1 Routine telemedicine\\n   (a) Patient-initiated or second opinion telemedicine should be restricted to situations\\n       in which a previously existing healthcare-patient relationship enables the\\n       healthcare practitioner to gather sufficient knowledge of the patient’s clinical\\n       condition to be able to render a proper and clinically justifiable diagnosis,\\n       treatment or recommendation.\\n   (b) This recommendation is in line with the WMA’s regulations that telemedicine is\\n       only used as an adjunct to normal medical practice, and only replaces face-to-\\n       face services where the quality and safety of patient care is not compromised\\n       and the best available resources are used in securing and transmitting patient\\n       information.\\n                                              15\\n\\n4.8.2 Specialist telemedicine\\n   (a) Specialist telemedicine consultations form the bulk of telemedicine practice in\\n       South Africa because of human resource capacity challenges – particularly in\\n       rural areas.\\n   (b) These challenges do not however mean that patients should be over- or under-\\n       serviced.\\n   (c) The ethical guidelines for good practice as well as the ethical rules of conduct for\\n       practitioners registered with the HPCSA should be taken into consideration at all\\n       times.\\n4.8.3 Emergency telemedicine\\n   (a) Emergency telemedicine involves judgements by the healthcare practitioner often\\n       based on sub-optimal patient information.\\n   (b) In emergencies, the health and wellbeing of the patient are the determining\\n       factors with regard to stabilising the patient and having the patient referred for\\n       thorough medical care.\\n   (c) The practitioner must provide the patient with emergency instructions when the\\n       care provided by telemedicine indicates that a referral to an acute care or\\n       emergency facility is necessary for the immediate treatment of the patient.\\n   (d) The emergency instructions should be in writing and appropriate to the services\\n       being rendered via telemedicine.\\n4.9 Quality, security and safety of patient information and records\\nRules on confidentiality and security of patient information applies to telemedicine as\\nwell, especially with regard to transmission and storage.\\n4.9.1 Every registered healthcare practitioner engaging in telemedicine practices takes\\n       responsibility for the quality of service delivered as well as confidentiality, security\\n       and safety of patients’ information.\\n                                               16\\n\\n4.9.2 Patient information and records should consist of copies of all patient-related\\nelectronic communications, including:\\n       (a) Patient-practitioners communications;\\n       (b) Prescriptions;\\n       (c) Laboratory and test results;\\n       (d) Evaluations and consultations;\\n       (e) Records of past care;\\n       (f) Instructions obtained or produced in connection telemedicine technologies;\\n           and\\n       (g) Signed informed consents to treatment and use of telemedicine.\\n4.9.3 The patient’s records established during the use of telemedicine must be\\n       accessible and documented for both the healthcare practitioners involved and\\n       their patients.\\n4.9.4 It is the registered healthcare practitioner’s responsibility to ensure that non-\\n       registered personnel who may be offering auxiliary or technical services, are\\n       aware of the need for such quality, security and safety and that they adhere to\\n       the stipulated guidelines.\\n4.9.5 Quality assurance\\n   (a) Healthcare practitioners, both from the consulting and servicing sites, should not\\n       practice telemedicine without ensuring that the equipment and accessories used\\n       are optimally operational.\\n   (b) Periodical quality control tests and servicing of equipment should be carried out\\n       and records kept for verification.\\n   (c) The quality and quantity of patient information received should be sufficient and\\n       relevant for the patient’s clinical condition in order to ensure that accurate\\n       medical decisions and recommendations are made for the benefit of the patient.\\n   (d) Good communication contributes to quality patient information being transmitted\\n       from one practitioner to the other.\\n                                              17\\n\\n   (e) Quality should further be ascertained in the manner of documenting patient\\n        information.\\n   (f) A standardised manner of documentation is recommended to ensure that all\\n        healthcare practitioners adhere to the same protocol in terms of history taking,\\n        reporting on findings, creation of reserves and hard copies where necessary.\\n   (g) Where images are transmitted from one location to the other, it is the\\n        responsibility of both the consulting and servicing practitioner to ensure that there\\n        is no critical loss of image resolution from acquisition to final display.\\n4.9.6 Security\\n   (a) Patient information should only be transmitted from one site to the other and\\n      stored, with the full knowledge and approval of the patient, in line with the informed\\n      consent guidelines.\\n   (b) Only the information that is relevant to the clinical history of the patient should be\\n        transmitted electronically.\\n   (c) To protect the identity of the patient when information is transmitted between\\n        sites, it is essential that personal identification should be removed and the\\n        transmitted information is encrypted.\\n   (d) All personal computers of the telemedicine service should be accessed by\\n        authorised personnel only through the use of a login password.\\n   (e) There are three factors central to the security of patient information, namely:\\n                  i) Privacy: Who can access it?\\n                 ii) Authenticity: Who sends the information?\\n                 iii) Integrity: Has the information been altered during its transmission\\n                 through the public networks?\\n   (f) Access to information by other healthcare practitioner, patients or third party\\n        should be authorised by the healthcare provider in charge of the patient and be\\n        carried out according to the rules and regulations as outlined in the Promotion of\\n        Access to Information Act, of 2000.\\n                                                  18\\n\\n4.9.7 Safety\\n       Health care practitioners using telemedicine should:\\n   (a) Avoid accidental damage and loss of patient information;\\n   (b) Provide safe procedures to avoid any alteration or elimination of patient data;\\n   (c) Ensure that patient information obtained electronically is kept in line with the\\n       HPCSA’s guidelines on the keeping of patients’ records in Booklet 15;\\n   (d) Comply with the legal requirements for data messages in the Electronic\\n       Communications and Transactions Act No 25 of 2002 regarding the protection of\\n       information and the principles regarding the electronic collection of personal\\n       information.\\n

       "'INTRODUCTION\\textbackslash{}n1.1 The objective of the South African Telemedicine System as established by the\\textbackslash{}n    National Department of Health is to deliver healthcare services at a distance to\\textbackslash{}n    South African communities in under-served areas. The system has been established\\textbackslash{}n    to alleviate the human resource crisis as experienced and is geared to improve the\\textbackslash{}n    links and communication between developed healthcare facilities and the\\textbackslash{}n    underdeveloped rural areas. Different categories of Health Care Practitioners will be\\textbackslash{}n    involved.\\textbackslash{}n1.2 The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) has a mandate to regulate\\textbackslash{}n    healthcare provision by ensuring that services are provided by qualified and skilled\\textbackslash{}n    healthcare practitioners. This regulatory mandate applies to healthcare practitioner\\textbackslash{}n    in both state and privately-owned health care institutions. It is the mandate of the\\textbackslash{}n    HPCSA to protect the “patient” against possible abuse by healthcare practitioner on\\textbackslash{}n    one hand and to provide guidance for good practice to the professions.\\textbackslash{}n1.3 All Telemedicine services should involve a healthcare provider where there is an\\textbackslash{}n    actual face-to-face consultation and physical examination of the patient in a clinical\\textbackslash{}n    setting. The consulting practitioner will communicate the information to the servicing\\textbackslash{}n    practitioner, who will then provide the necessary assistance.\\textbackslash{}nNote: These guidelines must be read as a whole and not piece-meal as the overall\\textbackslash{}npurpose may be lost. The guidelines must further be read in conjunction with\\textbackslash{}nother ethical booklets of the HPCSA which include but are not limited to:\\textbackslash{}n        Booklet No 1: General ethical guidelines for healthcare professions\\textbackslash{}n        Booklet No 9: Seeking patients’ informed consent\\textbackslash{}n        Booklet No 10: Confidentiality\\textbackslash{}n                                               5\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}n2. PURPOSE\\textbackslash{}nThe purpose of these guidelines is twofold:\\textbackslash{}n       (a) Firstly to provide an ethical framework that draws from the core values and\\textbackslash{}n       standards in Booklet No 1 and pertinent laws.\\textbackslash{}n       (b) Secondly, to provide guidelines to Healthcare Practitioners engaged in\\textbackslash{}n       telemedicine practices within and outside the South Africa.\\textbackslash{}n3. DEFINITION OF CONCEPTS\\textbackslash{}nThese guidelines first provide definitions of telemedicine and other related terminology\\textbackslash{}nas used in the guidelines.\\textbackslash{}n3.1 Telemedicine\\textbackslash{}nFor the purposes of these guidelines, “telemedicine” is defined as:\\textbackslash{}n       The practice of medicine using electronic communications, information\\textbackslash{}n       technology or other electronic means between a healthcare practitioner in one\\textbackslash{}n       location and a healthcare practitioner in another location for the purpose of\\textbackslash{}n       facilitating, improving and enhancing clinical, educational and scientific\\textbackslash{}n       healthcare and research, particularly to the under serviced areas in the Republic\\textbackslash{}n       of South Africa.\\textbackslash{}nNote:\\textbackslash{}n 1. Telemedicine involves secure videoconferencing or similar forms of technology\\textbackslash{}n     which enable healthcare practitioners to replicate the interaction of traditional face-\\textbackslash{}n     to-face consultations between healthcare practitioners and the patient.\\textbackslash{}n                                              6\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}n  2. Telemedicine as defined refers to where information is exchanged electronically\\textbackslash{}n     either on or off-line, formally, informally or as a need for a second opinion.\\textbackslash{}n3.2 Health establishment\\textbackslash{}n“Health establishment” means the whole or part of a public or private institution, facility,\\textbackslash{}nbuilding or place, whether for profit or not, that is designed to provide inpatient or\\textbackslash{}noutpatient treatment, and diagnostic or therapeutic interventions\\textbackslash{}n3.3 Healthcare practitioner\\textbackslash{}n“Healthcare practitioner” means a person providing health services, registered in terms\\textbackslash{}nof the Health Professions Act No 56 of 1974, to include any other appropriate disciplines\\textbackslash{}nas defined in the National Health Act No 61 of 2003.\\textbackslash{}n3.4 The consulting healthcare practitioner\\textbackslash{}nThe “consulting healthcare practitioner” refers to the practitioner who conducts a “face-\\textbackslash{}nto-face” interview or examination with the patient or refers patient’s information to a\\textbackslash{}nremote location for further advice or intervention.\\textbackslash{}n3.5 The servicing healthcare practitioner\\textbackslash{}nThe “servicing healthcare practitioner” refers to the practitioner who offers advice or\\textbackslash{}nintervention or patient information from a remote location.\\textbackslash{}n3.6 The requesting patient\\textbackslash{}nThe “requesting patient” is the patient who requests to be treated by the servicing\\textbackslash{}nhealthcare practitioner. This applies only where there is already an existing relationship\\textbackslash{}nbetween the patient and the healthcare practitioner.\\textbackslash{}n                                                7\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}n3.7 Other terms that relate to consultation\\textbackslash{}nOther terms relate to consultation as used in telemedicine as described by the World\\textbackslash{}nMedical Association:\\textbackslash{}n3.7.1 Asynchronous: Refers to data transmission that involves a mechanism where the\\textbackslash{}n       patient information from the consulting healthcare practitioner\\textbackslash{}'s site is temporarily\\textbackslash{}n       stored and then retransmitted to the servicing healthcare practitioner\\textbackslash{}'s site or vice\\textbackslash{}n       versa. A common asynchronous transmission includes the transmission of\\textbackslash{}n       patient information via email.\\textbackslash{}n3.7.2 Synchronous: Refers to the continuous, uninterrupted transmission of patient\\textbackslash{}n       information from the consulting health care practitioner\\textbackslash{}'s site to the consultant\\textbackslash{}n       health care practitioner\\textbackslash{}'s site, or vice versa. The flow of patient information does\\textbackslash{}n       not include any storage or intended delay in the transmission of the patient data.\\textbackslash{}n4. ETHICAL GUIDELINES\\textbackslash{}nAlthough telemedicine has become an essential tool in alleviating human resource\\textbackslash{}ncrises and supporting primary healthcare services, particularly those of vulnerable\\textbackslash{}ncommunities in South Africa. It also raises important ethical and legal issues.\\textbackslash{}n4.1 Competence, registration and authorisation\\textbackslash{}n4.1.1 According to the Health Professions Act, No 56 of 1974, registration is a\\textbackslash{}n       prerequisite for practising a profession in terms of which a professional board has\\textbackslash{}n       been established, where such practice is for gain within South Africa, or for any\\textbackslash{}n       other health profession the scope which has been defined by the Minister in\\textbackslash{}n       terms of the Act, unless a practitioner is registered in terms of the Act in respect\\textbackslash{}n       of such profession.\\textbackslash{}n4.1.2 Only practitioners who have been deemed competent and are registered in their\\textbackslash{}n       respective professions are authorised to participate in telemedicine practice in\\textbackslash{}n                                               8\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}n      South Africa either as consulting healthcare practitioners or servicing healthcare\\textbackslash{}n      practitioners.\\textbackslash{}n4.1.3 In the case of telemedicine across country borders, practitioners serving South\\textbackslash{}n      African patients should be registered with the regulating bodies in their original\\textbackslash{}n      states as well as with the HPCSA.\\textbackslash{}n4.1.4 Consulting healthcare practitioners are responsible for ensuring that the servicing\\textbackslash{}n      healthcare practitioner is competent according to South African healthcare\\textbackslash{}n      standards.\\textbackslash{}n4.1.5 Consulting healthcare practitioners and servicing healthcare practitioners are\\textbackslash{}n      held to the same standards of medical practice as healthcare practitioners who\\textbackslash{}n      conduct face-to-face consultations.\\textbackslash{}n4.2   Healthcare practitioner-patient relationship\\textbackslash{}n4.2.1 The relationship between the patient and the healthcare practitioner is\\textbackslash{}n      established when the practitioner agrees to treat the patient and the patient\\textbackslash{}n      agrees to be treated.\\textbackslash{}n4.2.2 In telemedicine the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at\\textbackslash{}n      the time telemedicine technologies are used.\\textbackslash{}n4.2.3 The relationship between the patient and the healthcare practitioner must be\\textbackslash{}n      based on mutual trust and respect, and this applies to both servicing and\\textbackslash{}n      consulting practitioners.\\textbackslash{}n4.2.4 Core ethical values as outlined in the HPCSA guidelines for Healthcare\\textbackslash{}n      practitioners are also applicable in telemedicine practice and the fact that a\\textbackslash{}n      patient’s information can be moved using electronic means does not alter the\\textbackslash{}n      ethical duties of health care practitioner.\\textbackslash{}n                                              9\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}n4.2.5 The professional discretion of healthcare practitioners engaging in telemedicine\\textbackslash{}n        regarding the diagnosis, scope of care or treatment should not be limited or\\textbackslash{}n        influenced by non-clinical considerations of telemedicine technologies.\\textbackslash{}n4.3 Assumption of primary responsibility\\textbackslash{}n4.3.1 The World Medical Association (WMA) makes a distinction between telemedicine\\textbackslash{}n        consulting and the servicing practitioners regarding where the primary\\textbackslash{}n        responsibility lies.\\textbackslash{}n4.3.2 According to the WMA:\\textbackslash{}n    (a) The consulting practitioner remains responsible for the treatment, decisions and\\textbackslash{}n        other recommendations given to the patient, as well as for keeping detailed\\textbackslash{}n        records of the patient’s condition and information transmitted and received from\\textbackslash{}n        the servicing practitioner.\\textbackslash{}n    (b) The servicing practitioner must keep detailed records of the advice he or she\\textbackslash{}n        delivers as well as the information he or she receives and on which the advice is\\textbackslash{}n        based.\\textbackslash{}n    (c) The servicing practitioner must further ensure that the advice or treatment\\textbackslash{}n        suggestions given were understood by the consulting practitioner or the patient.\\textbackslash{}n4.4     Evaluation and treatment of patient\\textbackslash{}n4.4.1 A documented medical evaluation must be done and the relevant clinical history\\textbackslash{}n        necessary to diagnose underlying conditions as well as any contra-indications\\textbackslash{}n        regarding the recommended treatment must be obtained before providing\\textbackslash{}n        treatment, including issuing prescriptions, electronically or otherwise.\\textbackslash{}n                                              10\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}n4.4.2 Treatment, including issuing a prescription based solely on an online\\textbackslash{}n        questionnaire does not constitute an acceptable standard of care.\\textbackslash{}n4.4.3 When prescribing care using telemedicine consulting practitioners should ensure\\textbackslash{}n        that informed consent is taken in accordance with the standards practice used in\\textbackslash{}n        face-to-face issuing of prescriptions.\\textbackslash{}n4.5     Professional duties\\textbackslash{}n4.5.1 Healthcare practitioners engaging in telemedicine must observe the professional\\textbackslash{}n        duties imposed in the HPCSA’s General Ethical Guidelines for Good Practice.\\textbackslash{}n4.5.2 Duties to patients include, but are not limited to, always acting in the best interest\\textbackslash{}n        or well-being of the patient, respecting patients’ privacy and dignity, giving\\textbackslash{}n        patients the information they need about their conditions, and maintaining\\textbackslash{}n        confidentiality at all times as required by the National Health Act No 61 of 2003\\textbackslash{}n        and the SA National Patients’ Rights Charter.\\textbackslash{}n4.5.3 Healthcare practitioners should not give medical advice or provide treatment\\textbackslash{}n        using telemedicine without obtaining proper informed consent from the patient for\\textbackslash{}n        both the treatment to be given and the use of telemedicine technology.\\textbackslash{}n4.5.4 The consulting and servicing healthcare practitioners they should verify:\\textbackslash{}n    (a) The location of the consulting or servicing healthcare practitioner;\\textbackslash{}n    (b) The identity and qualifications of the consulting or servicing healthcare\\textbackslash{}n        practitioner; and\\textbackslash{}n    (c) The identity of the patient.\\textbackslash{}n                                               11\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}n4.6 Duty to inform and informed consent\\textbackslash{}n4.6.1 This section must be read in conjunction with HPCSA guidelines regarding\\textbackslash{}n      informed consent in Booklet 9 and the provisions of the National Health Act.\\textbackslash{}n4.6.2 Informed consent for the use of telemedicine technologies must be obtained in\\textbackslash{}n      writing.\\textbackslash{}n4.6.3 Informed consent documentation for telemedicine practice should include the\\textbackslash{}n      following:\\textbackslash{}n      (a) The identities of the patient and the servicing healthcare practitioner.\\textbackslash{}n      (b) The servicing healthcare practitioner’s practice number.\\textbackslash{}n      (c) The types of transmissions consented to using telemedicine technologies\\textbackslash{}n          (e.g. prescriptions, refills, appointment scheduling, patient education etc.).\\textbackslash{}n      (d) Agreement by the patient that the servicing practitioner will decide whether or\\textbackslash{}n          not the condition being diagnosed or treated is appropriate for a telemedicine\\textbackslash{}n          consultation.\\textbackslash{}n      (e) Details of the security measures taken with the use of telemedicine\\textbackslash{}n          technologies, such as encrypting data, password protected screen savers and\\textbackslash{}n          data files, or the use of other reliable authentication techniques.\\textbackslash{}n      (f) Any material risks to confidentiality arising from the use of telemedicine\\textbackslash{}n          technologies that may influence the patient’s decision to consent.\\textbackslash{}n      (g) The patient’s express consent to the transmission of the patient’s personal\\textbackslash{}n          medical information to a consulting healthcare practitioner or other\\textbackslash{}n          appropriate third parties.\\textbackslash{}n4.6.3 When telemedicine is used the patient should be informed regarding who will\\textbackslash{}naccess their information, the purpose of the telemedicine service, the cost of the service\\textbackslash{}nand what the implications of the use of such information will be.\\textbackslash{}n                                              12\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}n4.6.4 It is the duty and responsibility of the consulting practitioner to obtain informed\\textbackslash{}nconsent for telemedicine purposes.\\textbackslash{}n4.6.5 The documentation regarding informed consent for telemedicine practice should\\textbackslash{}n       include the following:\\textbackslash{}n   (a) The patient’s name and address and the location or site of consultation;\\textbackslash{}n   (b) The consulting practitioner’s name, practice address and number, and location;\\textbackslash{}n   (c) The servicing practitioner’s or practitioner’s names, practice addresses and\\textbackslash{}n       numbers, and location;\\textbackslash{}n   (d) A brief explanation of telemedicine;\\textbackslash{}n   (e) The types of transmissions consented to using telemedicine technologies (e.g.\\textbackslash{}n       prescriptions, refills, appointment scheduling, patient education etc.).\\textbackslash{}n   (f) Details of the security measures taken with the use of telemedicine technologies,\\textbackslash{}n       such as encrypting data, password protected screen savers and data files, or the\\textbackslash{}n       use of other reliable authentication techniques.\\textbackslash{}n   (g) Any material risks to confidentiality arising from the use of telemedicine\\textbackslash{}n       technologies that may influence the patient’s decision to consent.\\textbackslash{}n   (h) The expected risks, possible benefits of and alternatives to telemedicine;\\textbackslash{}n   (i) Agreement by the patient that the servicing practitioner will decide whether or not\\textbackslash{}n       the condition being

case of videoconference consultations, the patient must be aware of the\\textbackslash{}n       presence of other people on the other side, and that the patient’s identity may be\\textbackslash{}n       revealed to such people, and must consent to this.\\textbackslash{}n4.7 Patient confidentiality\\textbackslash{}n4.7.1 The patient must at all times be assured that their confidentiality is protected.\\textbackslash{}n4.7.2 Patient confidentiality should be ensured at both the consulting and servicing\\textbackslash{}n       practitioners’\\textbackslash{}n       sites and should follow the provisions of the Constitution, the National Health Act\\textbackslash{}n       No 61 of 2003, the Promotion of Access to Information Act No 2 of 2000, the\\textbackslash{}n       Protection of Personal Information Act No 4 of 2013, the Common law and the\\textbackslash{}n       HPCSA’s ethical guidelines on patient confidentiality in Booklet 10 which\\textbackslash{}n       generally state that it is every practitioner’s duty to make sure that information is\\textbackslash{}n       effectively protected against improper disclosure at all times.\\textbackslash{}n4.7.3 HPCSA’s booklet on Confidentiality further provides guidelines on how patient\\textbackslash{}n       information may be disclosed for example, in the case of research, education,\\textbackslash{}n       clinical audit, financial audit or even for the publication of case histories and\\textbackslash{}n       photographs{]}.\\textbackslash{}n4.7.4 Policies and procedures for documentation, maintenance and transmission of\\textbackslash{}n       records regarding telemedicine consultations should be maintained at the same\\textbackslash{}n       standard of care as face-to-face consultations.\\textbackslash{}n4.7.5 Policies and procedures for telemedicine should deal with: (a) Confidentiality; (b)\\textbackslash{}n       Healthcare personnel apart from the healthcare practitioners who will process the\\textbackslash{}n       electronic information; (c) Hours of operation; (d) Types of transactions that are\\textbackslash{}n       permitted electronically; (e) Required patient information to be included in\\textbackslash{}n       electronic communications (e.g. name, identification number and type of\\textbackslash{}n       transaction); (f) Archival and retrieval oversight mechanisms; and (g) Quality\\textbackslash{}n       oversight mechanisms.\\textbackslash{}n                                               14\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}n4.7.6 Electronic transmissions, (e.g. email, prescriptions and laboratory results) must\\textbackslash{}n       be secure within existing technology (e.g. password protected, encrypted\\textbackslash{}n       electronic prescriptions or other reliable authentication techniques). It is the\\textbackslash{}n       responsibility of the healthcare practitioners to ensure that these non-healthcare\\textbackslash{}n       personnel do not violate patient confidentiality.\\textbackslash{}n4.7.7 All patient-practitioner electronic communications must be stored and filed in the\\textbackslash{}n       patient’s medical record file in line with traditional record-keeping policies and\\textbackslash{}n       procedures.\\textbackslash{}n4.8 Routine, specialists and emergency consultations\\textbackslash{}nThere is a need to provide guidelines on routine, emergency or specialist consultations\\textbackslash{}nusing telemedicine technologies.\\textbackslash{}n4.8.1 Routine telemedicine\\textbackslash{}n   (a) Patient-initiated or second opinion telemedicine should be restricted to situations\\textbackslash{}n       in which a previously existing healthcare-patient relationship enables the\\textbackslash{}n       healthcare practitioner to gather sufficient knowledge of the patient’s clinical\\textbackslash{}n       condition to be able to render a proper and clinically justifiable diagnosis,\\textbackslash{}n       treatment or recommendation.\\textbackslash{}n   (b) This recommendation is in line with the WMA’s regulations that telemedicine is\\textbackslash{}n       only used as an adjunct to normal medical practice, and only replaces face-to-\\textbackslash{}n       face services where the quality and safety of patient care is not compromised\\textbackslash{}n       and the best available resources are used in securing and transmitting patient\\textbackslash{}n       information.\\textbackslash{}n                                              15\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}n4.8.2 Specialist telemedicine\\textbackslash{}n   (a) Specialist telemedicine consultations form the bulk of telemedicine practice in\\textbackslash{}n       South Africa because of human resource capacity challenges – particularly in\\textbackslash{}n       rural areas.\\textbackslash{}n   (b) These challenges do not however mean that patients should be over- or under-\\textbackslash{}n       serviced.\\textbackslash{}n   (c) The ethical guidelines for good practice as well as the ethical rules of conduct for\\textbackslash{}n       practitioners registered with the HPCSA should be taken into consideration at all\\textbackslash{}n       times.\\textbackslash{}n4.8.3 Emergency telemedicine\\textbackslash{}n   (a) Emergency telemedicine involves judgements by the healthcare practitioner often\\textbackslash{}n       based on sub-optimal patient information.\\textbackslash{}n   (b) In emergencies, the health and wellbeing of the patient are the determining\\textbackslash{}n       factors with regard to stabilising the patient and having the patient referred for\\textbackslash{}n       thorough medical care.\\textbackslash{}n   (c) The practitioner must provide the patient with emergency instructions when the\\textbackslash{}n       care provided by telemedicine indicates that a referral to an acute care or\\textbackslash{}n       emergency facility is necessary for the immediate treatment of the patient.\\textbackslash{}n   (d) The emergency instructions should be in writing and appropriate to the services\\textbackslash{}n       being rendered via telemedicine.\\textbackslash{}n4.9 Quality, security and safety of patient information and records\\textbackslash{}nRules on confidentiality and security of patient information applies to telemedicine as\\textbackslash{}nwell, especially with regard to transmission and storage.\\textbackslash{}n4.9.1 Every registered healthcare practitioner engaging in telemedicine practices takes\\textbackslash{}n       responsibility for the quality of service delivered as well as confidentiality, security\\textbackslash{}n       and safety of patients’ information.\\textbackslash{}n                                               16\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}n4.9.2 Patient information and records should consist of copies of all patient-related\\textbackslash{}nelectronic communications, including:\\textbackslash{}n       (a) Patient-practitioners communications;\\textbackslash{}n       (b) Prescriptions;\\textbackslash{}n       (c) Laboratory and test results;\\textbackslash{}n       (d) Evaluations and consultations;\\textbackslash{}n       (e) Records of past care;\\textbackslash{}n       (f) Instructions obtained or produced in connection telemedicine technologies;\\textbackslash{}n           and\\textbackslash{}n       (g) Signed informed consents to treatment and use of telemedicine.\\textbackslash{}n4.9.3 The patient’s records established during the use of telemedicine must be\\textbackslash{}n       accessible and documented for both the healthcare practitioners involved and\\textbackslash{}n       their patients.\\textbackslash{}n4.9.4 It is the registered healthcare practitioner’s responsibility to ensure that non-\\textbackslash{}n       registered personnel who may be offering auxiliary or technical services, are\\textbackslash{}n       aware of the need for such quality, security and safety and that they adhere to\\textbackslash{}n       the stipulated guidelines.\\textbackslash{}n4.9.5 Quality assurance\\textbackslash{}n   (a) Healthcare practitioners, both from the consulting and servicing sites, should not\\textbackslash{}n       practice telemedicine without ensuring that the equipment and accessories used\\textbackslash{}n       are optimally operational.\\textbackslash{}n   (b) Periodical quality control tests and servicing of equipment should be carried out\\textbackslash{}n       and records kept for verification.\\textbackslash{}n   (c) The quality and quantity of patient information received should be sufficient and\\textbackslash{}n       relevant for the patient’s clinical condition in order to ensure that accurate\\textbackslash{}n       medical decisions and recommendations are made for the benefit of the patient.\\textbackslash{}n   (d) Good communication contributes to quality patient information being transmitted\\textbackslash{}n       from one practitioner to the other.\\textbackslash{}n                                              17\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}n   (e) Quality should further be ascertained in the manner of documenting patient\\textbackslash{}n        information.\\textbackslash{}n   (f) A standardised manner of documentation is recommended to ensure that all\\textbackslash{}n        healthcare practitioners adhere to the same protocol in terms of history taking,\\textbackslash{}n        reporting on findings, creation of reserves and hard copies where necessary.\\textbackslash{}n   (g) Where images are transmitted from one location to the other, it is the\\textbackslash{}n        responsibility of both the consulting and servicing practitioner to ensure that there\\textbackslash{}n        is no critical loss of image resolution from acquisition to final display.\\textbackslash{}n4.9.6 Security\\textbackslash{}n   (a) Patient information should only be transmitted from one site to the other and\\textbackslash{}n      stored, with the full knowledge and approval of the patient, in line with the informed\\textbackslash{}n      consent guidelines.\\textbackslash{}n   (b) Only the information that is relevant to the clinical history of the patient should be\\textbackslash{}n        transmitted electronically.\\textbackslash{}n   (c) To protect the identity of the patient when information is transmitted between\\textbackslash{}n        sites, it is essential that personal identification should be removed and the\\textbackslash{}n        transmitted information is encrypted.\\textbackslash{}n   (d) All personal computers of the telemedicine service should be accessed by\\textbackslash{}n        authorised personnel only through the use of a login password.\\textbackslash{}n   (e) There are three factors central to the security of patient information, namely:\\textbackslash{}n                  i) Privacy: Who can access it?\\textbackslash{}n                 ii) Authenticity: Who sends the information?\\textbackslash{}n                 iii) Integrity: Has the information been altered during its transmission\\textbackslash{}n                 through the public networks?\\textbackslash{}n   (f) Access to information by other healthcare practitioner, patients or third party\\textbackslash{}n        should be authorised by the healthcare provider in charge of the patient and be\\textbackslash{}n        carried out according to the rules and regulations as outlined in the Promotion of\\textbackslash{}n        Access to Information Act, of 2000.\\textbackslash{}n

       "<span style=white-space:pre-wrap>'INTRODUCTION\\n1.1 The objective of the South African Telemedicine System as established by the\\n    National Department of Health is to deliver healthcare services at a distance to\\n    South African communities in under-served areas. The system has been established\\n    to alleviate the human resource crisis as experienced and is geared to improve the\\n    links and communication between developed healthcare facilities and the\\n    underdeveloped rural areas. Different categories of Health Care Practitioners will be\\n    involved.\\n1.2 The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) has a mandate to regulate\\n    healthcare provision by ensuring that services are provided by qualified and skilled\\n    healthcare practitioners. This regulatory mandate applies to healthcare practitioner\\n    in both state and privately-owned health care institutions. It is the mandate of the\\n    HPCSA to protect the “patient” against possible abuse by healthcare practitioner on\\n    one hand and to provide guidance for good practice to the professions.\\n1.3 All Telemedicine services should involve a healthcare provider where there is an\\n    actual face-to-face consultation and physical examination of the patient in a clinical\\n    setting. The consulting practitioner will communicate the information to the servicing\\n    practitioner, who will then provide the necessary assistance.\\nNote: These guidelines must be read as a whole and not piece-meal as the overall\\npurpose may be lost. The guidelines must further be read in conjunction with\\nother ethical booklets of the HPCSA which include but are not limited to:\\n        Booklet No 1: General ethical guidelines for healthcare professions\\n        Booklet No 9: Seeking patients’ informed consent\\n        Booklet No 10: Confidentiality\\n                                               5\\n\\n2. PURPOSE\\nThe purpose of these guidelines is twofold:\\n       (a) Firstly to provide an ethical framework that draws from the core values and\\n       standards in Booklet No 1 and pertinent laws.\\n       (b) Secondly, to provide guidelines to Healthcare Practitioners engaged in\\n       telemedicine practices within and outside the South Africa.\\n3. DEFINITION OF CONCEPTS\\nThese guidelines first provide definitions of telemedicine and other related terminology\\nas used in the guidelines.\\n3.1 Telemedicine\\nFor the purposes of these guidelines, “telemedicine” is defined as:\\n       The practice of medicine using electronic communications, information\\n       technology or other electronic means between a healthcare practitioner in one\\n       location and a healthcare practitioner in another location for the purpose of\\n       facilitating, improving and enhancing clinical, educational and scientific\\n       healthcare and research, particularly to the under serviced areas in the Republic\\n       of South Africa.\\nNote:\\n 1. Telemedicine involves secure videoconferencing or similar forms of technology\\n     which enable healthcare practitioners to replicate the interaction of traditional face-\\n     to-face consultations between healthcare practitioners and the patient.\\n                                              6\\n\\n  2. Telemedicine as defined refers to where information is exchanged electronically\\n     either on or off-line, formally, informally or as a need for a second opinion.\\n3.2 Health establishment\\n“Health establishment” means the whole or part of a public or private institution, facility,\\nbuilding or place, whether for profit or not, that is designed to provide inpatient or\\noutpatient treatment, and diagnostic or therapeutic interventions\\n3.3 Healthcare practitioner\\n“Healthcare practitioner” means a person providing health services, registered in terms\\nof the Health Professions Act No 56 of 1974, to include any other appropriate disciplines\\nas defined in the National Health Act No 61 of 2003.\\n3.4 The consulting healthcare practitioner\\nThe “consulting healthcare practitioner” refers to the practitioner who conducts a “face-\\nto-face” interview or examination with the patient or refers patient’s information to a\\nremote location for further advice or intervention.\\n3.5 The servicing healthcare practitioner\\nThe “servicing healthcare practitioner” refers to the practitioner who offers advice or\\nintervention or patient information from a remote location.\\n3.6 The requesting patient\\nThe “requesting patient” is the patient who requests to be treated by the servicing\\nhealthcare practitioner. This applies only where there is already an existing relationship\\nbetween the patient and the healthcare practitioner.\\n                                                7\\n\\n3.7 Other terms that relate to consultation\\nOther terms relate to consultation as used in telemedicine as described by the World\\nMedical Association:\\n3.7.1 Asynchronous: Refers to data transmission that involves a mechanism where the\\n       patient information from the consulting healthcare practitioner\\'s site is temporarily\\n       stored and then retransmitted to the servicing healthcare practitioner\\'s site or vice\\n       versa. A common asynchronous transmission includes the transmission of\\n       patient information via email.\\n3.7.2 Synchronous: Refers to the continuous, uninterrupted transmission of patient\\n       information from the consulting health care practitioner\\'s site to the consultant\\n       health care practitioner\\'s site, or vice versa. The flow of patient information does\\n       not include any storage or intended delay in the transmission of the patient data.\\n4. ETHICAL GUIDELINES\\nAlthough telemedicine has become an essential tool in alleviating human resource\\ncrises and supporting primary healthcare services, particularly those of vulnerable\\ncommunities in South Africa. It also raises important ethical and legal issues.\\n4.1 Competence, registration and authorisation\\n4.1.1 According to the Health Professions Act, No 56 of 1974, registration is a\\n       prerequisite for practising a profession in terms of which a professional board has\\n       been established, where such practice is for gain within South Africa, or for any\\n       other health profession the scope which has been defined by the Minister in\\n       terms of the Act, unless a practitioner is registered in terms of the Act in respect\\n       of such profession.\\n4.1.2 Only practitioners who have been deemed competent and are registered in their\\n       respective professions are authorised to participate in telemedicine practice in\\n                                               8\\n\\n      South Africa either as consulting healthcare practitioners or servicing healthcare\\n      practitioners.\\n4.1.3 In the case of telemedicine across country borders, practitioners serving South\\n      African patients should be registered with the regulating bodies in their original\\n      states as well as with the HPCSA.\\n4.1.4 Consulting healthcare practitioners are responsible for ensuring that the servicing\\n      healthcare practitioner is competent according to South African healthcare\\n      standards.\\n4.1.5 Consulting healthcare practitioners and servicing healthcare practitioners are\\n      held to the same standards of medical practice as healthcare practitioners who\\n      conduct face-to-face consultations.\\n4.2   Healthcare practitioner-patient relationship\\n4.2.1 The relationship between the patient and the healthcare practitioner is\\n      established when the practitioner agrees to treat the patient and the patient\\n      agrees to be treated.\\n4.2.2 In telemedicine the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at\\n      the time telemedicine technologies are used.\\n4.2.3 The relationship between the patient and the healthcare practitioner must be\\n      based on mutual trust and respect, and this applies to both servicing and\\n      consulting practitioners.\\n4.2.4 Core ethical values as outlined in the HPCSA guidelines for Healthcare\\n      practitioners are also applicable in telemedicine practice and the fact that a\\n      patient’s information can be moved using electronic means does not alter the\\n      ethical duties of health care practitioner.\\n                                              9\\n\\n4.2.5 The professional discretion of healthcare practitioners engaging in telemedicine\\n        regarding the diagnosis, scope of care or treatment should not be limited or\\n        influenced by non-clinical considerations of telemedicine technologies.\\n4.3 Assumption of primary responsibility\\n4.3.1 The World Medical Association (WMA) makes a distinction between telemedicine\\n        consulting and the servicing practitioners regarding where the primary\\n        responsibility lies.\\n4.3.2 According to the WMA:\\n    (a) The consulting practitioner remains responsible for the treatment, decisions and\\n        other recommendations given to the patient, as well as for keeping detailed\\n        records of the patient’s condition and information transmitted and received from\\n        the servicing practitioner.\\n    (b) The servicing practitioner must keep detailed records of the advice he or she\\n        delivers as well as the information he or she receives and on which the advice is\\n        based.\\n    (c) The servicing practitioner must further ensure that the advice or treatment\\n        suggestions given were understood by the consulting practitioner or the patient.\\n4.4     Evaluation and treatment of patient\\n4.4.1 A documented medical evaluation must be done and the relevant clinical history\\n        necessary to diagnose underlying conditions as well as any contra-indications\\n        regarding the recommended treatment must be obtained before providing\\n        treatment, including issuing prescriptions, electronically or otherwise.\\n                                              10\\n\\n4.4.2 Treatment, including issuing a prescription based solely on an online\\n        questionnaire does not constitute an acceptable standard of care.\\n4.4.3 When prescribing care using telemedicine consulting practitioners should ensure\\n        that informed consent is taken in accordance with the standards practice used in\\n        face-to-face issuing of prescriptions.\\n4.5     Professional duties\\n4.5.1 Healthcare practitioners engaging in telemedicine must observe the professional\\n        duties imposed in the HPCSA’s General Ethical Guidelines for Good Practice.\\n4.5.2 Duties to patients include, but are not limited to, always acting in the best interest\\n        or well-being of the patient, respecting patients’ privacy and dignity, giving\\n        patients the information they need about their conditions, and maintaining\\n        confidentiality at all times as required by the National Health Act No 61 of 2003\\n        and the SA National Patients’ Rights Charter.\\n4.5.3 Healthcare practitioners should not give medical advice or provide treatment\\n        using telemedicine without obtaining proper informed consent from the patient for\\n        both the treatment to be given and the use of telemedicine technology.\\n4.5.4 The consulting and servicing healthcare practitioners they should verify:\\n    (a) The location of the consulting or servicing healthcare practitioner;\\n    (b) The identity and qualifications of the consulting or servicing healthcare\\n        practitioner; and\\n    (c) The identity of the patient.\\n                                               11\\n\\n4.6 Duty to inform and informed consent\\n4.6.1 This section must be read in conjunction with HPCSA guidelines regarding\\n      informed consent in Booklet 9 and the provisions of the National Health Act.\\n4.6.2 Informed consent for the use of telemedicine technologies must be obtained in\\n      writing.\\n4.6.3 Informed consent documentation for telemedicine practice should include the\\n      following:\\n      (a) The identities of the patient and the servicing healthcare practitioner.\\n      (b) The servicing healthcare practitioner’s practice number.\\n      (c) The types of transmissions consented to using telemedicine technologies\\n          (e.g. prescriptions, refills, appointment scheduling, patient education etc.).\\n      (d) Agreement by the patient that the servicing practitioner will decide whether or\\n          not the condition being diagnosed or treated is appropriate for a telemedicine\\n          consultation.\\n      (e) Details of the security measures taken with the use of telemedicine\\n          technologies, such as encrypting data, password protected screen savers and\\n          data files, or the use of other reliable authentication techniques.\\n      (f) Any material risks to confidentiality arising from the use of telemedicine\\n          technologies that may influence the patient’s decision to consent.\\n      (g) The patient’s express consent to the transmission of the patient’s personal\\n          medical information to a consulting healthcare practitioner or other\\n          appropriate third parties.\\n4.6.3 When telemedicine is used the patient should be informed regarding who will\\naccess their information, the purpose of the telemedicine service, the cost of the service\\nand what the implications of the use of such information will be.\\n                                              12\\n\\n4.6.4 It is the duty and responsibility of the consulting practitioner to obtain informed\\nconsent for telemedicine purposes.\\n4.6.5 The documentation regarding informed consent for telemedicine practice should\\n       include the following:\\n   (a) The patient’s name and address and the location or site of consultation;\\n   (b) The consulting practitioner’s name, practice address and number, and location;\\n   (c) The servicing practitioner’s or practitioner’s names, practice addresses and\\n       numbers, and location;\\n   (d) A brief explanation of telemedicine;\\n   (e) The types of transmissions consented to using telemedicine technologies (e.g.\\n       prescriptions, refills, appointment scheduling, patient education etc.).\\n   (f) Details of the security measures taken with the use of telemedicine technologies,\\n       such as encrypting data, password protected screen savers and data files, or the\\n       use of other reliable authentication techniques.\\n   (g) Any material risks to confidentiality arising from the use of telemedicine\\n       technologies that may influence the patient’s decision to consent.\\n   (h) The expected risks, possible benefits of and alternatives to telemedicine;\\n   (i) Agreement by the patient that the servicing practitioner will decide whether or not\\n       the condition being diagnosed or treated is appropriate for a telemedicine\\n       consultation.\\n   (j) The patient’s agreement, after a full explanation was given, including the\\n       patient’s express consent to the transmission of the patient’s personal medical\\n       information to a consulting healthcare practitioner or other appropriate third\\n       parties.\\n   (k) The signature of patient, the patient’s parent, the patient’s guardian or the\\n       patient’s caregiver - the relationship to the patient should be specified;\\n   (l) The signature of the witness.\\n                                              13\\n\\n4.6.6 A copy of the consent form should be kept with patient’s records and a duplicate\\n       given to the patient.\\n4.6.7 In the case of videoconference consultations, the patient must be aware of the\\n       presence of other people on the other side, and that the patient’s identity may be\\n       revealed to such people, and must consent to this.\\n4.7 Patient confidentiality\\n4.7.1 The patient must at all times be assured that their confidentiality is protected.\\n4.7.2 Patient confidentiality should be ensured at both the consulting and servicing\\n       practitioners’\\n       sites and should follow the provisions of the Constitution, the National Health Act\\n       No 61 of 2003, the Promotion of Access to Information Act No 2 of 2000, the\\n       Protection of Personal Information Act No 4 of 2013, the Common law and the\\n       HPCSA’s ethical guidelines on patient confidentiality in Booklet 10 which\\n       generally state that it is every practitioner’s duty to make sure that information is\\n       effectively protected against improper disclosure at all times.\\n4.7.3 HPCSA’s booklet on Confidentiality further provides guidelines on how patient\\n       information may be disclosed for example, in the case of research, education,\\n       clinical audit, financial audit or even for the publication of case histories and\\n       photographs].\\n4.7.4 Policies and procedures for documentation, maintenance and transmission of\\n       records regarding telemedicine consultations should be maintained at the same\\n       standard of care as face-to-face consultations.\\n4.7.5 Policies and procedures for telemedicine should deal with: (a) Confidentiality; (b)\\n       Healthcare personnel apart from the healthcare practitioners who will process the\\n       electronic information; (c) Hours of operation; (d) Types of transactions that are\\n       permitted electronically; (e) Required patient information to be included in\\n       electronic communications (e.g. name, identification number and type of\\n       transaction); (f) Archival and retrieval oversight mechanisms; and (g) Quality\\n       oversight mechanisms.\\n                                               14\\n\\n4.7.6 Electronic transmissions, (e.g. email, prescriptions and laboratory results) must\\n       be secure within existing technology (e.g. password protected, encrypted\\n       electronic prescriptions or other reliable authentication techniques). It is the\\n       responsibility of the healthcare practitioners to ensure that these non-healthcare\\n       personnel do not violate patient confidentiality.\\n4.7.7 All patient-practitioner electronic communications must be stored and filed in the\\n       patient’s medical record file in line with traditional record-keeping policies and\\n       procedures.\\n4.8 Routine, specialists and emergency consultations\\nThere is a need to provide guidelines on routine, emergency or specialist consultations\\nusing telemedicine technologies.\\n4.8.1 Routine telemedicine\\n   (a) Patient-initiated or second opinion telemedicine should be restricted to situations\\n       in which a previously existing healthcare-patient relationship enables the\\n       healthcare practitioner to gather sufficient knowledge of the patient’s clinical\\n       condition to be able to render a proper and clinically justifiable diagnosis,\\n       treatment or recommendation.\\n   (b) This recommendation is in line with the WMA’s regulations that telemedicine is\\n       only used as an adjunct to normal medical practice, and only replaces face-to-\\n       face services where the quality and safety of patient care is not compromised\\n       and the best available resources are used in securing and transmitting patient\\n       information.\\n                                              15\\n\\n4.8.2 Specialist telemedicine\\n   (a) Specialist telemedicine consultations form the bulk of telemedicine practice in\\n       South Africa because of human resource capacity challenges – particularly in\\n       rural areas.\\n   (b) These challenges do not however mean that patients should be over- or under-\\n       serviced.\\n   (c) The ethical guidelines for good practice as well as the ethical rules of conduct for\\n       practitioners registered with the HPCSA should be taken into consideration at all\\n       times.\\n4.8.3 Emergency telemedicine\\n   (a) Emergency telemedicine involves judgements by the healthcare practitioner often\\n       based on sub-optimal patient information.\\n   (b) In emergencies, the health and wellbeing of the patient are the determining\\n       factors with regard to stabilising the patient and having the patient referred for\\n       thorough medical care.\\n   (c) The practitioner must provide the patient with emergency instructions when the\\n       care provided by telemedicine indicates that a referral to an acute care or\\n       emergency facility is necessary for the immediate treatment of the patient.\\n   (d) The emergency instructions should be in writing and appropriate to the services\\n       being rendered via telemedicine.\\n4.9 Quality, security and safety of patient information and records\\nRules on confidentiality and security of patient information applies to telemedicine as\\nwell, especially with regard to transmission and storage.\\n4.9.1 Every registered healthcare practitioner engaging in telemedicine practices takes\\n       responsibility for the quality of service delivered as well as confidentiality, security\\n       and safety of patients’ information.\\n                                               16\\n\\n4.9.2 Patient information and records should consist of copies of all patient-related\\nelectronic communications, including:\\n       (a) Patient-practitioners communications;\\n       (b) Prescriptions;\\n       (c) Laboratory and test results;\\n       (d) Evaluations and consultations;\\n       (e) Records of past care;\\n       (f) Instructions obtained or produced in connection telemedicine technologies;\\n           and\\n       (g) Signed informed consents to treatment and use of telemedicine.\\n4.9.3 The patient’s records established during the use of telemedicine must be\\n       accessible and documented for both the healthcare practitioners involved and\\n       their patients.\\n4.9.4 It is the registered healthcare practitioner’s responsibility to ensure that non-\\n       registered personnel who may be offering auxiliary or technical services, are\\n       aware of the need for such quality, security and safety and that they adhere to\\n       the stipulated guidelines.\\n4.9.5 Quality assurance\\n   (a) Healthcare practitioners, both from the consulting and servicing sites, should not\\n       practice telemedicine without ensuring that the equipment and accessories used\\n       are optimally operational.\\n   (b) Periodical quality control tests and servicing of equipment should be carried out\\n       and records kept for verification.\\n   (c) The quality and quantity of patient information received should be sufficient and\\n       relevant for the patient’s clinical condition in order to ensure that accurate\\n       medical decisions and recommendations are made for the benefit of the patient.\\n   (d) Good communication contributes to quality patient information being transmitted\\n       from one practitioner to the other.\\n                                              17\\n\\n   (e) Quality should further be ascertained in the manner of documenting patient\\n        information.\\n   (f) A standardised manner of documentation is recommended to ensure that all\\n        healthcare practitioners adhere to the same protocol in terms of history taking,\\n        reporting on findings, creation of reserves and hard copies where necessary.\\n   (g) Where images are transmitted from one location to the other, it is the\\n        responsibility of both the consulting and servicing practitioner to ensure that there\\n        is no critical loss of image resolution from acquisition to final display.\\n4.9.6 Security\\n   (a) Patient information should only be transmitted from one site to the other and\\n      stored, with the full knowledge and approval of the patient, in line with the informed\\n      consent guidelines.\\n   (b) Only the information that is relevant to the clinical history of the patient should be\\n        transmitted electronically.\\n   (c) To protect the identity of the patient when information is transmitted between\\n        sites, it is essential that personal identification should be removed and the\\n        transmitted information is encrypted.\\n   (d) All personal computers of the telemedicine service should be accessed by\\n        authorised personnel only through the use of a login password.\\n   (e) There are three factors central to the security of patient information, namely:\\n                  i) Privacy: Who can access it?\\n                 ii) Authenticity: Who sends the information?\\n                 iii) Integrity: Has the information been altered during its transmission\\n                 through the public networks?\\n   (f) Access to information by other healthcare practitioner, patients or third party\\n        should be authorised by the healthcare provider in charge of the patient and be\\n        carried out according to the rules and regulations as outlined in the Promotion of\\n        Access to Information Act, of 2000.\\n                                                  18\\n\\n4.9.7 Safety\\n       Health care practitioners using telemedicine should:\\n   (a) Avoid accidental damage and loss of patient information;\\n   (b) Provide safe procedures to avoid any alteration or elimination of patient data;\\n   (c) Ensure that patient information obtained electronically is kept in line with the\\n       HPCSA’s guidelines on the keeping of patients’ records in Booklet 15;\\n   (d) Comply with the legal requirements for data messages in the Electronic\\n       Communications and Transactions Act No 25 of 2002 regarding the protection of\\n       information and the principles regarding the electronic collection of personal\\n       information.\\n

       "[1] \"INTRODUCTION\\n1.1 The objective of the South African Telemedicine System as established by the\\n    National Department of Health is to deliver healthcare services at a distance to\\n    South African communities in under-served areas. The system has been established\\n    to alleviate the human resource crisis as experienced and is geared to improve the\\n    links and communication between developed healthcare facilities and the\\n    underdeveloped rural areas. Different categories of Health Care Practitioners will be\\n    involved.\\n1.2 The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) has a mandate to regulate\\n    healthcare provision by ensuring that services are provided by qualified and skilled\\n    healthcare practitioners. This regulatory mandate applies to healthcare practitioner\\n    in both state and privately-owned health care institutions. It is the mandate of the\\n    HPCSA to protect the “patient” against possible abuse by healthcare practitioner on\\n    one hand and to provide guidance for good practice to the professions.\\n1.3 All Telemedicine services should involve a healthcare provider where there is an\\n    actual face-to-face consultation and physical examination of the patient in a clinical\\n    setting. The consulting practitioner will communicate the information to the servicing\\n    practitioner, who will then provide the necessary assistance.\\nNote: These guidelines must be read as a whole and not piece-meal as the overall\\npurpose may be lost. The guidelines must further be read in conjunction with\\nother ethical booklets of the HPCSA which include but are not limited to:\\n        Booklet No 1: General ethical guidelines for healthcare professions\\n        Booklet No 9: Seeking patients’ informed consent\\n        Booklet No 10: Confidentiality\\n                                               5\\n\\n2. PURPOSE\\nThe purpose of these guidelines is twofold:\\n       (a) Firstly to provide an ethical framework that draws from the core values and\\n       standards in Booklet No 1 and pertinent laws.\\n       (b) Secondly, to provide guidelines to Healthcare Practitioners engaged in\\n       telemedicine practices within and outside the South Africa.\\n3. DEFINITION OF CONCEPTS\\nThese guidelines first provide definitions of telemedicine and other related terminology\\nas used in the guidelines.\\n3.1 Telemedicine\\nFor the purposes of these guidelines, “telemedicine” is defined as:\\n       The practice of medicine using electronic communications, information\\n       technology or other electronic means between a healthcare practitioner in one\\n       location and a healthcare practitioner in another location for the purpose of\\n       facilitating, improving and enhancing clinical, educational and scientific\\n       healthcare and research, particularly to the under serviced areas in the Republic\\n       of South Africa.\\nNote:\\n 1. Telemedicine involves secure videoconferencing or similar forms of technology\\n     which enable healthcare practitioners to replicate the interaction of traditional face-\\n     to-face consultations between healthcare practitioners and the patient.\\n                                              6\\n\\n  2. Telemedicine as defined refers to where information is exchanged electronically\\n     either on or off-line, formally, informally or as a need for a second opinion.\\n3.2 Health establishment\\n“Health establishment” means the whole or part of a public or private institution, facility,\\nbuilding or place, whether for profit or not, that is designed to provide inpatient or\\noutpatient treatment, and diagnostic or therapeutic interventions\\n3.3 Healthcare practitioner\\n“Healthcare practitioner” means a person providing health services, registered in terms\\nof the Health Professions Act No 56 of 1974, to include any other appropriate disciplines\\nas defined in the National Health Act No 61 of 2003.\\n3.4 The consulting healthcare practitioner\\nThe “consulting healthcare practitioner” refers to the practitioner who conducts a “face-\\nto-face” interview or examination with the patient or refers patient’s information to a\\nremote location for further advice or intervention.\\n3.5 The servicing healthcare practitioner\\nThe “servicing healthcare practitioner” refers to the practitioner who offers advice or\\nintervention or patient information from a remote location.\\n3.6 The requesting patient\\nThe “requesting patient” is the patient who requests to be treated by the servicing\\nhealthcare practitioner. This applies only where there is already an existing relationship\\nbetween the patient and the healthcare practitioner.\\n                                                7\\n\\n3.7 Other terms that relate to consultation\\nOther terms relate to consultation as used in telemedicine as described by the World\\nMedical Association:\\n3.7.1 Asynchronous: Refers to data transmission that involves a mechanism where the\\n       patient information from the consulting healthcare practitioner's site is temporarily\\n       stored and then retransmitted to the servicing healthcare practitioner's site or vice\\n       versa. A common asynchronous transmission includes the transmission of\\n       patient information via email.\\n3.7.2 Synchronous: Refers to the continuous, uninterrupted transmission of patient\\n       information from the consulting health care practitioner's site to the consultant\\n       health care practitioner's site, or vice versa. The flow of patient information does\\n       not include any storage or intended delay in the transmission of the patient data.\\n4. ETHICAL GUIDELINES\\nAlthough telemedicine has become an essential tool in alleviating human resource\\ncrises and supporting primary healthcare services, particularly those of vulnerable\\ncommunities in South Africa. It also raises important ethical and legal issues.\\n4.1 Competence, registration and authorisation\\n4.1.1 According to the Health Professions Act, No 56 of 1974, registration is a\\n       prerequisite for practising a profession in terms of which a professional board has\\n       been established, where such practice is for gain within South Africa, or for any\\n       other health profession the scope which has been defined by the Minister in\\n       terms of the Act, unless a practitioner is registered in terms of the Act in respect\\n       of such profession.\\n4.1.2 Only practitioners who have been deemed competent and are registered in their\\n       respective professions are authorised to participate in telemedicine practice in\\n                                               8\\n\\n      South Africa either as consulting healthcare practitioners or servicing healthcare\\n      practitioners.\\n4.1.3 In the case of telemedicine across country borders, practitioners serving South\\n      African patients should be registered with the regulating bodies in their original\\n      states as well as with the HPCSA.\\n4.1.4 Consulting healthcare practitioners are responsible for ensuring that the servicing\\n      healthcare practitioner is competent according to South African healthcare\\n      standards.\\n4.1.5 Consulting healthcare practitioners and servicing healthcare practitioners are\\n      held to the same standards of medical practice as healthcare practitioners who\\n      conduct face-to-face consultations.\\n4.2   Healthcare practitioner-patient relationship\\n4.2.1 The relationship between the patient and the healthcare practitioner is\\n      established when the practitioner agrees to treat the patient and the patient\\n      agrees to be treated.\\n4.2.2 In telemedicine the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at\\n      the time telemedicine technologies are used.\\n4.2.3 The relationship between the patient and the healthcare practitioner must be\\n      based on mutual trust and respect, and this applies to both servicing and\\n      consulting practitioners.\\n4.2.4 Core ethical values as outlined in the HPCSA guidelines for Healthcare\\n      practitioners are also applicable in telemedicine practice and the fact that a\\n      patient’s information can be moved using electronic means does not alter the\\n      ethical duties of health care practitioner.\\n                                              9\\n\\n4.2.5 The professional discretion of healthcare practitioners engaging in telemedicine\\n        regarding the diagnosis, scope of care or treatment should not be limited or\\n        influenced by non-clinical considerations of telemedicine technologies.\\n4.3 Assumption of primary responsibility\\n4.3.1 The World Medical Association (WMA) makes a distinction between telemedicine\\n        consulting and the servicing practitioners regarding where the primary\\n        responsibility lies.\\n4.3.2 According to the WMA:\\n    (a) The consulting practitioner remains responsible for the treatment, decisions and\\n        other recommendations given to the patient, as well as for keeping detailed\\n        records of the patient’s condition and information transmitted and received from\\n        the servicing practitioner.\\n    (b) The servicing practitioner must keep detailed records of the advice he or she\\n        delivers as well as the information he or she receives and on which the advice is\\n        based.\\n    (c) The servicing practitioner must further ensure that the advice or treatment\\n        suggestions given were understood by the consulting practitioner or the patient.\\n4.4     Evaluation and treatment of patient\\n4.4.1 A documented medical evaluation must be done and the relevant clinical history\\n        necessary to diagnose underlying conditions as well as any contra-indications\\n        regarding the recommended treatment must be obtained before providing\\n        treatment, including issuing prescriptions, electronically or otherwise.\\n                                              10\\n\\n4.4.2 Treatment, including issuing a prescription based solely on an online\\n        questionnaire does not constitute an acceptable standard of care.\\n4.4.3 When prescribing care using telemedicine consulting practitioners should ensure\\n        that informed consent is taken in accordance with the standards practice used in\\n        face-to-face issuing of prescriptions.\\n4.5     Professional duties\\n4.5.1 Healthcare practitioners engaging in telemedicine must observe the professional\\n        duties imposed in the HPCSA’s General Ethical Guidelines for Good Practice.\\n4.5.2 Duties to patients include, but are not limited to, always acting in the best interest\\n        or well-being of the patient, respecting patients’ privacy and dignity, giving\\n        patients the information they need about their conditions, and maintaining\\n        confidentiality at all times as required by the National Health Act No 61 of 2003\\n        and the SA National Patients’ Rights Charter.\\n4.5.3 Healthcare practitioners should not give medical advice or provide treatment\\n        using telemedicine without obtaining proper informed consent from the patient for\\n        both the treatment to be given and the use of telemedicine technology.\\n4.5.4 The consulting and servicing healthcare practitioners they should verify:\\n    (a) The location of the consulting or servicing healthcare practitioner;\\n    (b) The identity and qualifications of the consulting or servicing healthcare\\n        practitioner; and\\n    (c) The identity of the patient.\\n                                               11\\n\\n4.6 Duty to inform and informed consent\\n4.6.1 This section must be read in conjunction with HPCSA guidelines regarding\\n      informed consent in Booklet 9 and the provisions of the National Health Act.\\n4.6.2 Informed consent for the use of telemedicine technologies must be obtained in\\n      writing.\\n4.6.3 Informed consent documentation for telemedicine practice should include the\\n      following:\\n      (a) The identities of the patient and the servicing healthcare practitioner.\\n      (b) The servicing healthcare practitioner’s practice number.\\n      (c) The types of transmissions consented to using telemedicine technologies\\n          (e.g. prescriptions, refills, appointment scheduling, patient education etc.).\\n      (d) Agreement by the patient that the servicing practitioner will decide whether or\\n          not the condition being diagnosed or treated is appropriate for a telemedicine\\n          consultation.\\n      (e) Details of the security measures taken with the use of telemedicine\\n          technologies, such as encrypting data, password protected screen savers and\\n          data files, or the use of other reliable authentication techniques.\\n      (f) Any material risks to confidentiality arising from the use of telemedicine\\n          technologies that may influence the patient’s decision to consent.\\n      (g) The patient’s express consent to the transmission of the patient’s personal\\n          medical information to a consulting healthcare practitioner or other\\n          appropriate third parties.\\n4.6.3 When telemedicine is used the patient should be informed regarding who will\\naccess their information, the purpose of the telemedicine service, the cost of the service\\nand what the implications of the use of such information will be.\\n                                              12\\n\\n4.6.4 It is the duty and responsibility of the consulting practitioner to obtain informed\\nconsent for telemedicine purposes.\\n4.6.5 The documentation regarding informed consent for telemedicine practice should\\n       include the following:\\n   (a) The patient’s name and address and the location or site of consultation;\\n   (b) The consulting practitioner’s name, practice address and number, and location;\\n   (c) The servicing practitioner’s or practitioner’s names, practice addresses and\\n       numbers, and location;\\n   (d) A brief explanation of telemedicine;\\n   (e) The types of transmissions consented to using telemedicine technologies (e.g.\\n       prescriptions, refills, appointment scheduling, patient education etc.).\\n   (f) Details of the security measures taken with the use of telemedicine technologies,\\n       such as encrypting data, password protected screen savers and data files, or the\\n       use of other reliable authentication techniques.\\n   (g) Any material risks to confidentiality arising from the use of telemedicine\\n       technologies that may influence the patient’s decision to consent.\\n   (h) The expected risks, possible benefits of and alternatives to telemedicine;\\n   (i) Agreement by the patient that the servicing practitioner will decide whether or not\\n       the condition being diagnosed or treated is appropriate for a telemedicine\\n       consultation.\\n   (j) The patient’s agreement, after a full explanation was given, including the\\n       patient’s express consent to the transmission of the patient’s personal medical\\n       information to a consulting healthcare practitioner or other appropriate third\\n       parties.\\n   (k) The signature of patient, the patient’s parent, the patient’s guardian or the\\n       patient’s caregiver - the relationship to the patient should be specified;\\n   (l) The signature of the witness.\\n                                              13\\n\\n4.6.6 A copy of the consent form should be kept with patient’s records and a duplicate\\n       given to the patient.\\n4.6.7 In the case of videoconference consultations, the patient must be aware of the\\n       presence of other people on the other side, and that the patient’s identity may be\\n       revealed to such people, and must consent to this.\\n4.7 Patient confidentiality\\n4.7.1 The patient must at all times be assured that their confidentiality is protected.\\n4.7.2 Patient confidentiality should be ensured at both the consulting and servicing\\n       practitioners’\\n       sites and should follow the provisions of the Constitution, the National Health Act\\n       No 61 of 2003, the Promotion of Access to Information Act No 2 of 2000, the\\n       Protection of Personal Information Act No 4 of 2013, the Common law and the\\n       HPCSA’s ethical guidelines on patient confidentiality in Booklet 10 which\\n       generally state that it is every practitioner’s duty to make sure that information is\\n       effectively protected against improper disclosure at all times.\\n4.7.3 HPCSA’s booklet on Confidentiality further provides guidelines on how patient\\n       information may be disclosed for example, in the case of research, education,\\n       clinical audit, financial audit or even for the publication of case histories and\\n       photographs].\\n4.7.4 Policies and procedures for documentation, maintenance and transmission of\\n       records regarding telemedicine consultations should be maintained at the same\\n       standard of care as face-to-face consultations.\\n4.7.5 Policies and procedures for telemedicine should deal with: (a) Confidentiality; (b)\\n       Healthcare personnel apart from the healthcare practitioners who will process the\\n       electronic information; (c) Hours of operation; (d) Types of transactions that are\\n       permitted electronically; (e) Required patient information to be included in\\n       electronic communications (e.g. name, identification number and type of\\n       transaction); (f) Archival and retrieval oversight mechanisms; and (g) Quality\\n       oversight mechanisms.\\n                                               14\\n\\n4.7.6 Electronic transmissions, (e.g. email, prescriptions and laboratory results) must\\n       be secure within existing technology (e.g. password protected, encrypted\\n       electronic prescriptions or other reliable authentication techniques). It is the\\n       responsibility of the healthcare practitioners to ensure that these non-healthcare\\n       personnel do not violate patient confidentiality.\\n4.7.7 All patient-practitioner electronic communications must be stored and filed in the\\n       patient’s medical record file in line with traditional record-keeping policies and\\n       procedures.\\n4.8 Routine, specialists and emergency consultations\\nThere is a need to provide guidelines on routine, emergency or specialist consultations\\nusing telemedicine technologies.\\n4.8.1 Routine telemedicine\\n   (a) Patient-initiated or second opinion telemedicine should be restricted to situations\\n       in which a previously existing healthcare-patient relationship enables the\\n       healthcare practitioner to gather sufficient knowledge of the patient’s clinical\\n       condition to be able to render a proper and clinically justifiable diagnosis,\\n       treatment or recommendation.\\n   (b) This recommendation is in line with the WMA’s regulations that telemedicine is\\n       only used as an adjunct to normal medical practice, and only replaces face-to-\\n       face services where the quality and safety of patient care is not compromised\\n       and the best available resources are used in securing and transmitting patient\\n       information.\\n                                              15\\n\\n4.8.2 Specialist telemedicine\\n   (a) Specialist telemedicine consultations form the bulk of telemedicine practice in\\n       South Africa because of human resource capacity challenges – particularly in\\n       rural areas.\\n   (b) These challenges do not however mean that patients should be over- or under-\\n       serviced.\\n   (c) The ethical guidelines for good practice as well as the ethical rules of conduct for\\n       practitioners registered with the HPCSA should be taken into consideration at all\\n       times.\\n4.8.3 Emergency telemedicine\\n   (a) Emergency telemedicine involves judgements by the healthcare practitioner often\\n       based on sub-optimal patient information.\\n   (b) In emergencies, the health and wellbeing of the patient are the determining\\n       factors with regard to stabilising the patient and having the patient referred for\\n       thorough medical care.\\n   (c) The practitioner must provide the patient with emergency instructions when the\\n       care provided by telemedicine indicates that a referral to an acute care or\\n       emergency facility is necessary for the immediate treatment of the patient.\\n   (d) The emergency instructions should be in writing and appropriate to the services\\n       being rendered via telemedicine.\\n4.9 Quality, security and safety of patient information and records\\nRules on confidentiality and security of patient information applies to telemedicine as\\nwell, especially with regard to transmission and storage.\\n4.9.1 Every registered healthcare practitioner engaging in telemedicine practices takes\\n       responsibility for the quality of service delivered as well as confidentiality, security\\n       and safety of patients’ information.\\n                                               16\\n\\n4.9.2 Patient information and records should consist of copies of all patient-related\\nelectronic communications, including:\\n       (a) Patient-practitioners communications;\\n       (b) Prescriptions;\\n       (c) Laboratory and test results;\\n       (d) Evaluations and consultations;\\n       (e) Records of past care;\\n       (f) Instructions obtained or produced in connection telemedicine technologies;\\n           and\\n       (g) Signed informed consents to treatment and use of telemedicine.\\n4.9.3 The patient’s records established during the use of telemedicine must be\\n       accessible and documented for both the healthcare practitioners involved and\\n       their patients.\\n4.9.4 It is the registered healthcare practitioner’s responsibility to ensure that non-\\n       registered personnel who may be offering auxiliary or technical services, are\\n       aware of the need for such quality, security and safety and that they adhere to\\n       the stipulated guidelines.\\n4.9.5 Quality assurance\\n   (a) Healthcare practitioners, both from the consulting and servicing sites, should not\\n       practice telemedicine without ensuring that the equipment and accessories used\\n       are optimally operational.\\n   (b) Periodical quality control tests and servicing of equipment should be carried out\\n       and records kept for verification.\\n   (c) The quality and quantity of patient information received should be sufficient and\\n       relevant for the patient’s clinical condition in order to ensure that accurate\\n       medical decisions and recommendations are made for the benefit of the patient.\\n   (d) Good communication contributes to quality patient information being transmitted\\n       from one practitioner to the other.\\n                                              17\\n\\n   (e) Quality should further be ascertained in the manner of documenting patient\\n        information.\\n   (f) A standardised manner of documentation is recommended to ensure that all\\n        healthcare practitioners adhere to the same protocol in terms of history taking,\\n        reporting on findings, creation of reserves and hard copies where necessary.\\n   (g) Where images are transmitted from one location to the other, it is the\\n        responsibility of both the consulting and servicing practitioner to ensure that there\\n        is no critical loss of image resolution from acquisition to final display.\\n4.9.6 Security\\n   (a) Patient information should only be transmitted from one site to the other and\\n      stored, with the full knowledge and approval of the patient, in line with the informed\\n      consent guidelines.\\n   (b) Only the information that is relevant to the clinical history of the patient should be\\n        transmitted electronically.\\n   (c) To protect the identity of the patient when information is transmitted between\\n        sites, it is essential that personal identification should be removed and the\\n        transmitted information is encrypted.\\n   (d) All personal computers of the telemedicine service should be accessed by\\n        authorised personnel only through the use of a login password.\\n   (e) There are three factors central to the security of patient information, namely:\\n                  i) Privacy: Who can access it?\\n                 ii) Authenticity: Who sends the information?\\n                 iii) Integrity: Has the information been altered during its transmission\\n                 through the public networks?\\n   (f) Access to information by other healthcare practitioner, patients or third party\\n        should be authorised by the healthcare provider in charge of the patient and be\\n        carried out according to the rules and regulations as outlined in the Promotion of\\n        Access to Information Act, of 2000.\\n                                                  18\\n\\n4.9.7 Safety\\n       Health care practitioners using telemedicine should:\\n   (a) Avoid accidental damage and loss of patient information;\\n   (b) Provide safe procedures to avoid any alteration or elimination of patient data;\\n   (c) Ensure that patient information obtained electronically is kept in line with the\\n       HPCSA’s guidelines on the keeping of patients’ records in Booklet 15;\\n   (d) Comply with the legal requirements for data messages in the Electronic\\n       Communications and Transactions Act No 25 of 2002 regarding the protection of\\n       information and the principles regarding the electronic collection of personal\\n       information.\\n                                            19\\n\\n5\""

The physician should exercise their professional autonomy in deciding whether a telemedicine versus face-to-face consultation is appropriate.\\n9. A physician should exercise autonomy and discretion in selecting the telemedicine platform to be used.\\nResponsibilities of the Physician\\n10. A physician whose advice is sought through the use of telemedicine should keep a detailed record of the advice he/she delivers as well as the information he/she received and on which the advice was based in order to ensure traceability.\\n11. If a decision is made to use telemedicine it is necessary to ensure that the users (patients and healthcare professionals) are able to use the necessary telecommunication system.\\n12. The physician must seek to ensure that the patient has understood the advice and treatment suggestions given and take steps in so far as possible to promote continuity of care.\\n13. The physician asking for another physician’s advice or second opinion remains responsible for treatment and other decisions and recommendations given to the patient.\\n14. The physician should be aware of and respect the special difficulties and uncertainties that may arise when he/she is in contact with the patient through means of tele-communication. A physician must be prepared to recommend direct patient-doctor contact when he/she believes it is in the patient’s best interests.\\n15. Physicians should only practise telemedicine in countries/jurisdictions where they are licenced to practise. Cross-jurisdiction consultations should only be allowed between two physicians.\\n16. Physicians should ensure that their medical indemnity cover include cover for telemedicine.\\nQuality of Care\\n17. Healthcare quality assessment measures must be used regularly to ensure patient security and the best possible diagnostic and treatment practices during telemedicine procedures. The delivery of telemedicine services must follow evidence-based practice guidelines to the degree they are available, to ensure patient safety, quality of care and positive health outcomes. Like all health care interventions, telemedicine must be tested for its effectiveness, efficiency, safety, feasibility and cost-effectiveness.\\n18. The possibilities and weaknesses of telemedicine in emergencies must be duly identified. If it is necessary to use telemedicine in an emergency situation, the advice and treatment suggestions are influenced by the severity of the patient´s medical condition and the competency of the persons who are with the patient. Entities that deliver telemedicine services must establish protocols for referrals for emergency services.\\nRECOMMENDATIONS\\nTelemedicine should be appropriately adapted to local regulatory frameworks, which may include licencing of telemedicine platforms in the best interest of patients.\\nWhere appropriate the WMA and National Medical Associations should encourage the development of ethical norms, practice guidelines, national legislation and international agreements on subjects related to the practice of telemedicine, while protecting the patient-physician relationship, confidentiality, and quality of medical care.\\nTelemedicine should not be viewed as equal to face-to-face healthcare and should not be introduced solely to cut costs or as a perverse incentive to over-service and increase earnings for physicians.\\nUse of telemedicine requires the profession to explicitly identify and manage adverse consequences on collegial relationships and referral patterns.\\nNew technologies and styles of practice integration may require new guidelines and standards.\\nPhysicians should lobby for ethical telemedicine practices that are in the best interests of patients.\\n22nd October 2018                                \\n\\n                                            P\""
